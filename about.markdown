This is the page of Owen Coutts. You may know me as the 7' tall guy, "The Canadian" if you are American, "The American" if you are Canadian.

Here is a more recent picture my father took of my mum, and my sister and me in the North Cascades of Washington.

Though I grew up in Seattle, these days you'll probably find me in Waterloo, near Toronto Ontario or in the Bay Area. I am studying at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) for Systems Design Engineering until 2014.
