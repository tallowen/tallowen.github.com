================
I spent the first four months of 2012 in California working at an internship with Mozilla. I started school following that time in Waterloo, near Toronto Ontario. I could have flown back to Waterloo but where is the fun in that. Instead, two friends flew to San Francisco and drove to Waterloo with me. 3000 miles later we made it to Waterloo.

Our first adventure took us to Alcatraz in the San Francisco bay. A beautiful day provided awesome views of the city and the surrounding bay.

The road through California, on the way to Yosemite:

On the first day of driving we made it to the Yosemite valley. This is the the land John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club originally fought so hard to preserve. These photos show Bridalvale Falls, Half Dome and other parts of Yosemtie Valley:

Giant freaking sequoia tree. OMFG a car fits through it.

The white stuff on either side of the road is salt. It just chills there. Salt Flats make really long really strait roads. We definitely weren't speeding, I promise:

After driving throught the desert of Nevada and the ensuing salt flats of eastern Nevada and Utah, we made it to Moab. We spend a day climbing around and looking at some pretty fly rocks.

Derping around, looking at an arch from an arch... arch-ception!!!

Learning to climb on the slick rock like a boss:

I can be an arch too:

The Green River. Its the largest tributary of the Colorado River, which carved out the Grand Canyon:

150 miles from Denver! Time to drive through some Rockies.

As we drove through the plains we hit some ligning storms. The big open skies make lightning that much scarier:

And then out of nowhere comes civilization in the middle of the plains. Welcome to the Chicago skyline!
