In March I went into the desert. I traveled with 3 others to south west of
Utah. We spent a few days backpacking around the [needles district][1] of
canyonlands national park. We continued to spend an afternoon in
[arches national park][2] followed by a day in the [island in the sky district][3] of canyonlands.

The sun bear the dolphin the goat and the moose set out on adventure. Here are some of the places they fearlessly wandered.
