p. ElasticSearch version @0.9.0@ has just been released. You can download it "here":/download. This is a major release for elasticsearch, both in terms of feature set as well as stability.

p. Major partial list of features include:

h2. Facets Support

p. "Facets":/guide/reference/api/search/facets/ allow to provide aggregated data view correlating to the search query executed. ElasticSearch now comes with several facets implementations, including the typical "terms" facets (allowing to get the most popular terms, and how often they occur), statistical facets providing statistical information on numeric fields including count, total, mean, min, max, variance, sum of squares, and standard deviation. And, the coolest facet type, histogram facets, which based on a field, break it into buckets and provide data on the relevant buckets derived from the same field, another field, or a script.

h2. Scripting Support

p. Added as a general feature within elasticsearch, "scripting":/guide/reference/modules/scripting.html allows to define scripts that are evaluated at runtime and can be used in different elasticsearch features, such as facets, script search fields, script filter, and so on.
