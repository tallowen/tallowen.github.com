title: Why I Didn't Vote
---

{{page.title}}
==============

Usually voting is a borderline religous activity for me. In my adult life, I have never failed to voted in an election that I was able to participate in. This includes both American and Canadian Elections. As a young voter I think it is important that young people, make thier voices heard.

On 6 October, Ontario held provincial elections. After showing up to Elections offices 3 times I didn't vote, and gave up my right to vote because I had other things to do. 

Though there are many things about the Canadian Elections system that are much better, many of the issues around voting that I faced are solved problems in Washington State.

## Online Information
Like any sterotypical young voter, I went strait to the internet to find out how to vote. Elections Ontario provides the ironically named website [wemakevotingeasy.ca][2]. I used the site to figure out where I needed to vote. I found an address based on my postal code after a lot of browsing through the website. As it turns out, the address I found was that of the retourning office.

Though finding the wrong address was a mistake on my part, the website should have been dead simple to use. A good elections website should allow a person to enter an address and get precise information about where to vote, what races they are voting on and what identification they need to bring.

## Online voter Registration
After having shown up to the retourning office, the election officials directed me to a local public school to vote. I found out that I needed prove of residence to vote. I was supprised - after having been on the elections website as well as speaking with an official in person, I hadn't realized that I needed to be carying proof of residency.

It is very hard as a student to prove where you live. I have lived in my current residence since the begining of this term (about 5 weeks) and I haven't gotten any mail that was addressed to me since I moved. It seems that the election system assumes that voters have a long term residence that recives a steady stream of mail.

I mistakenly imagined that since I had voted in the Canadian federal election in April that my information would be on file and I wouldn't have to prove again that I lived in Waterloo. Though I understand the rational behind forcing people to prove where they live in order to vote, it can be quite a burden.  Washington State only makes you prove your address in conjunction with getting drivers liscense. Since the identification system and the voting system are linked, people are able to use any ID to prove who they are and elections officials can then link that to a residence. 

Washington state maintains a [website][1] that allows voters to  login and recieve personalized information about which races they can vote in, how to vote and allows them to update thier personal information. 

## In Person Voting
The prefered method of voting in Ontario is voting in person. I had never voted in person before, I have always had my ballot mailed to me. In Washington State, it is very easy to setup and configure a mailing address for a ballot. By the time your ballot shows up, all you have to worry about is who you want to vote for. It also allows one to vote in an informed manner. Having a [web browser][3] open while you vote allows me to reasearch the candidates, make up my mind and vote all in one step. Voting ahead of the elections also leaves buffer time incase something goes wrong, like a misregistration.

My third attempt at voting involved me going to the bank to get a printed statement showing that I lived where I said I lived. I returned to the polling station with a printed statement that showed my address. Unfortunatley the printout I recived from the bank wasn't on official looking letterhead - it was simply a printout. This meant that when I arrived at the polling station I was unable to vote for the third time.

## Conclusions
A lot of the mistakes that I made are problems that I should have forseen. Had I done more research ahead of time I could have forseen that there was a problem. Furthermore, a lot of my cultural biases contributed to me making false assumptions that would have helped me vote successfully. 

Ultimatley, I shouldn't have to have put in the ammount of effort that I did. Aspects of the system are very difficult for young people to use. Though it is possible, I don't thin that the burden of voting should be that high. In the short term, voting online seems rather infeasible but eventualy intitiatives like that must be made to make voting accessable to all eligible electors.
