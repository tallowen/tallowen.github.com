### Building an arduino robot

I have been playing with an arduino lately. Right now I have a a little robot that rolls around nicely. I'm working on figuring out how to connect it to my android phone right now.

This is the belly of the beast. Two continious rotational servos drive the chasis while the white rollers allow it to turn.</p>

### Putting up a website
My most recent project has been this website. Although I worked on a webapp for four months while I worked at [Top Hat Monocle](http://tophatmonocle.com) I didn't really have a good appreciation for how many different layers go into a website.


Here are some of the things I realised I needed to learn:
- Where do I host a website? Most of the stuff I had done before involved a static IP and LAMP box. First I needed to find a hosting service that uses mod_python. I also learned how much I would miss my "sudo" command.
- How do you CSS and HTML? I'd done some basic stuff but mostly where all the CSS was in place and the HTML was somewhat generated already. I had to learn to do it from scratch. My first design was my <a href="resume">resume</a> and my second was this website.
- I just got hacked... My buddy saw my a temporary website and found a way into the django admin console. I had django-cms running which allowed him to change the page as he saw fit. Next time I'll watch my debug settings more carefully.
