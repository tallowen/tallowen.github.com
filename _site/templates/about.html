            This is the page of Owen Coutts. You may know me as the 7' tall guy, "The Canadian" if you are American,
            "The American" if you are Canadian, or "The German" if you are my family.

            Although I was born in Toronto I have spent most of my life in Seattle. I gained many fond memories growing
            up in Seattle. Many weekends were spent loading up the Ford Explorer and going camping, hiking or skiing
            depending on the season. Weekends not playing sports were often spent playing in a basketball tournament or
            playing ultimate frisbee in <a href="http:discnw.org">spring reign</a>.

            <p>I've always loved to build and tinker with things. When I was younger my Dad and I built various things such as a
            windmill with <a href="http://www.knex.com">k'nex</a>. By the time I was finishing highschool, it was an
            obvious choice to go into Engineering. I ended up at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of
            Waterloo</a>. I have been in the Systems Design Engineering Program since.</p>
