<p>
         I have been playing with an arduino lately. Right now I have a a little robot that rolls around nicely. I'm working on figuring out how to connect it to my android phone right now. 
</p>
<div id="arduino"></div>
<p>This is the belly of the beast. Two continious rotational servos drive the chasis while the white rollers allow it to turn.</p>

<h5>Putting up a website</h5>
<p>My most recent project has been this website. Although I worked on a webapp for four months while I worked at <a href="http://tophatmonocle.com">Top Hat Monocle </a> I didn't really have a good appreciation for how many different layers go into a website.
</p>
<p>
        Here are some of the things I realised I needed to learn:
    <ul>
        <li>Where do I host a website? Most of the stuff I had done before involved a static IP and LAMP box. First I needed to find a hosting service that uses mod_python. I also learned how much I would miss my "sudo" command.</li>
        <li>How do you CSS and HTML? I'd done some basic stuff but mostly where all the CSS was in place and the HTML was somewhat generated already. I had to learn to do it from scratch. My first design was my <a href="resume">resume</a> and my second was this website.</li>
        <li>I just got hacked... My buddy saw my a temporary website and found a way into the django admin console. I had django-cms running which allowed him to change the page as he saw fit. Next time I'll watch my debug settings more carefully.</li>
    </ul>
