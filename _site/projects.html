<p>I have been playing with an arduino lately. Right now I have a a little robot that rolls around nicely. I&#8217;m working on figuring out how to connect it to my android phone right now.</p>

<p><img src='/media/img/arduino.jpg' alt='Owenbot' /> This is the belly of the beast. Two continious rotational servos drive the chasis while the white rollers allow it to turn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3 id='putting_up_a_website'>Putting up a website</h3>

<p>My most recent project has been this website. Although I worked on a webapp for four months while I worked at <a href='http://tophatmonocle.com'>Top Hat Monocle</a> I didn&#8217;t really have a good appreciation for how many different layers go into a website.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I realised I needed to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I host a website? Most of the stuff I had done before involved a static IP and LAMP box. First I needed to find a hosting service that uses mod_python. I also learned how much I would miss my &#8220;sudo&#8221; command.</li>

<li>How do you CSS and HTML? I&#8217;d done some basic stuff but mostly where all the CSS was in place and the HTML was somewhat generated already. I had to learn to do it from scratch. My first design was my <a href='resume'>resume</a> and my second was this website.</li>

<li>I just got hacked&#8230; My buddy saw my a temporary website and found a way into the django admin console. I had django-cms running which allowed him to change the page as he saw fit. Next time I&#8217;ll watch my debug settings more carefully.</li>
