      <div id="content"><p>This is the page of Owen Coutts. You may know me as the 7&#8217; tall guy, &#8220;The Canadian&#8221; if you are American, &#8220;The American&#8221; if you are Canadian, or &#8220;The German&#8221; if you are my family.</p>

<p>Although I was born in Toronto I have spent most of my life in Seattle. I gained many fond memories growing up in Seattle. Many weekends were spent loading up the Ford Explorer and going camping, hiking or skiing depending on the season. Weekends not playing sports were often spent playing in a basketball tournament or playing ultimate frisbee in <a href='http:discnw.org'>spring reign</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a more recent picture my Dad took of me, my mum, and my sister.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always loved to build and tinker with things. When I was younger my Dad and I built various things such as a windmill with <a href='http://www.knex.com'>k&#8217;nex</a>. By the time I was finishing highschool, it was an obvious choice to go into Engineering. I ended up at the <a href='http://uwaterloo.ca'>University of Waterloo</a>. I have been in the Systems Design Engineering Program since.</p></div>
